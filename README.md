# linked_list

Welcome to this readme file for the linked list program! This program is designed to perform various functions related to linked lists, including creating nodes, sorting, inserting nodes, searching for specific nodes, and deleting lists. To start, let's talk about creating nodes. The program allows users to create nodes with taking a long string as an input. The input is parsed into words and each stored as a node which holds up to the 4 characters of the original word as well as the length of the original string. Once a node is created, it is linked to other nodes to form a linked list.

Next, let's discuss the sorting function. The program sorts a current list in an alphabetically ascending order. This makes it easier for users to organize and access the data in the list.

Another function of the program is inserting nodes. This allows users to add new nodes to the linked list at specific positions. Users can also insert nodes that are added to list alphabetically.

Finally, the program offers a search function that enables users to find specific nodes in the linked list. The search function supports case sensitive and case insensitive modes. Overall, this linked list program is a useful tool that supports a variety of functions for managing and organizing nodes in linked lists.
